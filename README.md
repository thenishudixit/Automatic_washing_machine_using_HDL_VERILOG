# Automatic_washing_machine_using_HDL_VERILOG
In the design of the source code, it was chosen that a case statement be the preference for the design. An FSM structure was chosen for the design. It was chosen that based on the number of states, a 3-bit signal would be enough to represent the state. There were a total of 6 states in our design. There is 1 “off” state for when the power is off, 1 “Check_Door ” state for when the machine is not running, or incrementing, and 6 states for the washing machine. We originally wanted to add two scenarios that we could handle, which are if the machine asynchronously loses power, or if the door asynchronously opens. We were successful in implementing both signals in the simulation. Then After the Check_Door State there is the Fill_Water state which checks that the water is filled in the drum. After that there is Add_Detergent state which checks if the detergent has been added. After it the Cycle stage is there which accomplishes the washing cycle, After that Drain _Water stage has been encountered which checks if the water has been drained out or not, and finally there is the Spin stage when the process has been completed the process is Finally Done and each stage has been changed after the encounter of the positive pulse of the clock only.
